Existing applications generally model accessibility based on distance or travel time. For pedestrians and cyclists, the street-level environment (e.g., green visibility, streetside amenities, dedicated infrastructure) significantly influences people’s willingness and ability to travel. Incorporating these features into accessibility models can help them to be more representative of active travellers’ experienced environment. \n\nThis study presents a methodology for incorporating the street-level environment into active mode accessibility. First, micro-scale built environment data from multiple sources are harmonised into a high-resolution digital representation of the land use and transport system. Second, a compute-optimised framework is developed for modelling accessibility at the micro-scale (i.e., each dwelling separately) incorporating the street-level environment. The methods build upon the open geodatabase OpenStreetMap and open-source MATSim project, facilitating expandability and transferability to other contexts. We apply this methodology to develop policyrelevant accessibility indicators for Greater Manchester. \n\nIn the results, we observe that the street-level environment can cause accessibility indicators to vary at the micro-scale, especially in less connected neighbourhoods where the choice of routes is limited. We also observed that for cyclists, the accessibility advantage over walking reduces substantially when traffic stress is considered. Our findings support further adoption of micro-scale built environment data and high-resolution analysis methods for active travel accessibility modelling in research and practice.","tags":null,"title":"Modelling active travel accessibility at the micro-scale using multi-source built environment data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afshin Jafari","Dhirendra Singh","Lucy Gunn","Alan Both","Billie Giles-Corti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1740787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740787200,"objectID":"8cf55a0479f6604a2394145ea1a5830f","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/publication/2025-cycling-infrastructure/","publishdate":"2025-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-cycling-infrastructure/","section":"publication","summary":"Cycling for transport is a sustainable alternative to using motorised vehicles for daily trips and is a key form of micromobility. Travel time is a critical factor influencing cycling route choice behaviour and uptake. Thus, it is important to understand the factors affecting cycling travel time and speed and their impact on cycling behaviour. In this study, an agent-based transport simulation model with heterogeneous cycling speeds was developed and used for Melbourne to study the impact of a hypothetical traffic signal optimisation intervention along six key cycling corridors. \n\nLinear regression and random forest models were used to identify factors affecting cycling speed, which informed the parameters of the agent-based model. Simulation outputs showed, on average, an increase of 4.1 % in the number of cyclists on the corridors, as existing cyclists chose to use these corridors, and an average reduction in cyclists’ moving travel time of 6.2 % for those using the intervention corridors (excluding time spent waiting at traffic signals). The findings provide insights into the effects of road attributes on cycling speed and behaviour, as well as the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing cycling delays. These insights are valuable for developing solutions to optimise urban infrastructure for micromobility, enhancing the efficiency and appeal of cycling as a viable transport option.","tags":null,"title":"Modelling the impact of road infrastructure on cycling moving speed","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Faith Macale"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1732320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732320000,"objectID":"ca959755756246d34c86e8f812cc583a","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/news/20241123-starweekly/","publishdate":"2024-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20241123-starweekly/","section":"news","summary":"*Star Weekly* \n\nNew data from the National Growth Areas Alliance (NGAA) shows that one-in-five Australians face inadequate access to doctors, schools, sports …","tags":null,"title":"NGAA proposes new funding model for Growth Areas","type":"news"},{"authors":["Cait Kelly","Josh Nicholas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1732147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732147200,"objectID":"a4b49afeeddb0dddc48b68de9a786c2c","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/news/20241121-theguardian/","publishdate":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20241121-theguardian/","section":"news","summary":"*The Guardian* \n\nToo many new developments lack green spaces and have fast food outlets built before essential infrastructure, peak body warns","tags":null,"title":"Australians in outer suburbs have far less access to schools, healthcare and public transport, report finds","type":"news"},{"authors":["Nicola Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1732147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732147200,"objectID":"d1d67e46948a4ceb37d1b88f0da4a4bd","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/news/20241121-thenightly/","publishdate":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20241121-thenightly/","section":"news","summary":"*The Nightly* \n\nOne in five Australians living in outer-metropolitan suburbs suffers inadequate access to schools, healthcare and other amenities and basic infrastructure, according to a new report.","tags":null,"title":"Suburbs set to be left behind as population booms","type":"news"},{"authors":["Matt Dennien"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1732147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732147200,"objectID":"6d281946964bbed87204e5608eefafe3","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/news/20241121-brisbanetimes/","publishdate":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20241121-brisbanetimes/","section":"news","summary":"*Brisbane Times* \n\nA report on liveability across five Australian capital cities has highlighted gaps between established and growing areas.

However, building these types of models at a city-wide level and including motorized (i.e. cars and public transport) and non-motorized (i.e. walk and bicycle) modes of transport is a complicated and involved task. This paper presents an open workflow for creating large-scale multi-modal agent-based transport simulation models. The workflow brings together a number of external tools, for example, an activity-based demand generation tool and a road network generation tool, and a set of tools developed for the agent-based model parameter estimation, calibration, and simulation post-processing. \n\nWe used this workflow to create an activity- and agent-based model for Melbourne and compared the output of the simulation model with observations from the real world in terms of mode share, road volume, travel time, and travel distance. Through these comparisons, we showed that our model is suitable for studying mode choice and road usage behavior of travelers. The calibrated model could be used to test road network change interventions. In addition, a similar workflow can be applied for building simulation models for other cities or could be expanded to include more complicated travel behaviors.","tags":null,"title":"Activity-based and agent-based transport model of Melbourne: an open multi-modal transport simulation model for Greater Melbourne","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annika Burgess"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719100800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719100800,"objectID":"e1149e6f7d35c550ddbd5a6149407608","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/news/20240623-abcnews/","publishdate":"2024-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20240623-abcnews/","section":"news","summary":"*ABC News* \n\nGentrification continues to expand further away from the centre of major cities.

Active transport (walking and cycling) contributes to population health by enabling physical activity. We developed a simulation model to measure health impacts of transport scenarios for Melbourne, Australia. Our aim was to demonstrate active transport health impacts and support the materialization of policies for healthy cities and people. The model measures health impacts of increased physical activity from replacing short car trips for any purpose or for commuting under 5 km by walking and cycling. \n\n*Methods* \n\nWe developed a micro-simulation model of physical activity and disease risk in combination with the well-established proportional multi-state life table model. We quantified life course health including health adjusted-life years, life years, new cases of diseases prevented, and deaths prevented for 14 chronic diseases associated with physical inactivity for the adult population of people from Melbourne, Australia in 2017. \n\n*Results* \n\nOver the life course of the Melbourne adult population of 3.6 million people in 2017, gains in health-adjusted life years ranged from 5,100 (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI) 3,700 to 6,500) for the scenario replacing commute trips by car under 1 km with walking up to 738,800 (95% UI 546,000 to 935,000) when replacing car trips under 2 km with walking and between 2 km and 5 km with cycling.

Spatial analytics processes are frequently complex, both conceptually and computationally. Adaptation, documention, and reproduction of bespoke spatial analytics procedures represents a growing challenge today, particularly in this era of big spatial data. Scientific workflow systems hold the promise of increased openness and transparency with improved automation of spatial analytics processes. In this work, we built and implemented a KNIME spatial analytics (“K-span”) software tool, an extension to the general-purpose open-source KNIME scientific workflow platform. The tool augments KNIME with new spatial analytics nodes by linking to and integrating a range of existing open-source spatial software and libraries. The implementation of the K-span system is demonstrated and evaluated with a case study associated with the original process of construction of the Australian national DEM (Digital Elevation Model) in the Greater Brisbane area of Queensland, Australia by Geoscience Australia (GA). The outcomes of translating example spatial analytics process into a an open, transparent, documented, automated, and reproducible scientific workflow highlights the benefits of using our system and our general approach.

The urgency to build neighbourhoods that encourage active transport has been accelerated locally and globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet achieving equitable access to walkable and cyclable neighbourhoods is challenging in low-density sprawling cities like Melbourne. Policymakers and health advocates are keen to understand how to change policies to deliver local living and a cycling-friendly Melbourne and the health and equity impacts of these policies. This is particularly relevant for those living in the most car-dependant areas and experiencing greater systemic spatial and health inequities. At RMIT’s Healthy Liveable Cities Lab (HLCL) we are building a city-wide computer transport and health simulation model for Greater Melbourne capable of assessing the impact of built environment change scenarios on individuals’ transport behaviour choices, their level of physical activity, exposure to air and noise pollution and greenspace, injury risk and health. However, the complexity of the model is a major obstacle in effective knowledge translation and therefore impact. \n\nThe VicHealth Impact Grant will catalyse the potential impact of our work by creating a tool to enable knowledge translation with transport, planning and health policymakers, technical practitioners, and advocates. We will co-create a visualisation tool for our transport and health model results with stakeholders to support creating and implementing healthy built environment policies. The tool will provide policy-relevant evidence on built environment change scenarios that maximise active transport uptake, redress spatial and health inequities and inform investments in high impact-built environment interventions. This project will benefit from our well-established collaborations with government and non-government organisations facilitated through HLCL’s Policy Advisory Group (PAG).

The ‘30 minute city’, where employment is accessible within 30 min by active transport, is being pursued in some cities to reduce congestion and foster local living. \n\nThis paper examines the spatial relationship between employment, the skills of residents, and transport opportunities, to answer three questions about Australia’s 21 largest cities: (1) What percentage of workers currently commute to their workplace within 30 min? (2) If workers were to shift to an active transport mode, what percent could reach their current workplace within 30 min? and (3) If it were possible to relocate workers closer to their employment or relocate employment closer to their home, what percentage could reach work within 30 min by each mode? \n\nActive transport usage in Australia is low, with public transport, walking, and cycling making up 16.8%, 2.8%, and 1.1% respectively of workers’ commutes. Cycling was found to have the most potential for achieving the 30 min city, with an estimated 29.5% of workers able to reach their current workplace were they to shift to cycling. This increased to 69.1% if workers were also willing and able to find a similar job closer to home, potentially reducing commuting by private motor vehicle from 79.3% to 30.9%.","tags":null,"title":"Achieving ‘Active’ 30 Minute Cities: How Feasible Is It to Reach Work within 30 Minutes Using Active Transport Modes?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afshin Jafari","Alan Both","Dhirendra Singh","Lucy Gunn","Billie Giles-Corti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"0ec9c58ef753b593fb72daf92f451358","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/publication/2022-network/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-network/","section":"publication","summary":"City-scale simulation modelling of active modes of transportation (i.e., walking and cycling) is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. The heterogeneous and complex behaviour of these transportation modes, however, indicates the need for a shift from the traditional car and public transport centred modelling approaches towards incorporating the requirements for walking and cycling behaviour, while maintaining the run-time efficiency of the models. In this paper, we introduce and test our algorithm to create road network representations, designed and optimised to be used in city-scale active transportation modelling. The algorithm relies on open and universal data. In addition to the major roads and attributes typically used in transport modelling (e.g., speed limit, number of lanes, permitted travel modes), the algorithm also captures minor roads usually favoured by pedestrians and cyclists, along with road attributes such as bicycle-specific infrastructure, traffic signals, road gradient and road surface type. Furthermore, it simplifies the complex geometries of the network and merges parallel roads, if applicable, to make it suitable for large-scale simulations. \n\nTo examine the utility and performance of the algorithm, we used it to create a network representation for Greater Melbourne, Australia, and compared the output with a network created using an existing simulation toolkit along with another network from an existing city-scale transport model from the Victorian government. Through simulation experiments with these networks, we illustrated that for routed trips on our network for walking and cycling, it is of comparable accuracy to the common network conversion tools in terms of travel distance of the shortest paths while being more than two times faster when used for simulating different sample sizes. Therefore, our algorithm offers a flexible and adjustable solution for users to create road networks for city-scale active transport modelling while balancing between their desired simulation accuracy and run-time.","tags":null,"title":"Building the road network for city-scale active transport simulation models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afshin Jafari","Dhirendra Singh","Alan Both","Lucy Gunn","Steve Pemberton","Billie Giles-Corti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639526400,"objectID":"8478407eb83ea086f230923c518fe040","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/publication/2021-atom/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-atom/","section":"publication","summary":"Agent-based and activity-based models for simulating transportation systems have attracted significant attention in recent years.

Yet the range of different but interrelated trajectory similarity measures can be bewildering for researchers and practitioners alike. This paper describes a systematic comparison and methodical exploration of trajectory similarity measures. Specifically, this paper compares five of the most important and commonly used similarity measures: dynamic time warping (DTW), edit distance (EDR), longest common subsequence (LCSS), discrete Fréchet distance (DFD), and Fréchet distance (FD). \n\nThe paper begins with a thorough conceptual and theoretical comparison. This comparison highlights the similarities and differences between measures in connection with six different characteristics, including their handling of a relative versus absolute time and space, tolerance to outliers, and computational efficiency. The paper further reports on an empirical evaluation of similarity in trajectories with contrasting properties: data about constrained bus movements in a transportation network, and the unconstrained movements of wading birds in a coastal environment. \n\nA set of four experiments: a. creates a measurement baseline by comparing similarity measures to a single trajectory subjected to various transformations; b. explores the behavior of similarity measures on network-constrained bus trajectories, grouped based on spatial and on temporal similarity; c. assesses similarity with respect to known behavioral annotations (flight and foraging of oystercatchers); and d. compares bird and bus activity to examine whether they are distinguishable based solely on their movement patterns. \n\nThe results show that in all instances both the absolute value and the ordering of similarity may be sensitive to the choice of measure. In general, all measures were more able to distinguish spatial differences in trajectories than temporal differences.

Currently, inventories of individual urban trees are conducted in-situ by professional arborists. Such an approach to urban tree inventories means they are challenging to maintain and only capture information describing trees on accessible land. Whilst remote sensing approaches have shown the potential to derive individual tree attributes, these studies rarely make use of existing inventory information. \n\nIn this study, we present a method to parameterise an algorithm for individual tree detection and delineation from airborne remote sensing data. The approach uses existing inventory data as training information firstly for the detection of the canopy area and secondly to parameterise a marker-based watershed segmentation algorithm. In this parameterisation, crown segmentation shape, as well as features derived from the remote sensing data, are used to determine if a segment contains one or more trees. If a segment contains more than one tree, it is split with the number of markers increased until each segment includes only one tree. \n\nThe approach was evaluated within three distinct urban areas: the central business district, an urban park and a residential area, to be determined. Commission and omission errors ranged between 11% and 27% across the three regions, with commission typically caused by land covers on private land that were unaccounted for in the training processes. In all areas the overall tree count was within two per cent of that defined by reference information. The accurate tree count produced by this approach suggests it has the potential to be adopted by government agencies for routine tree inventory maintenance.","tags":null,"title":"Linking urban tree inventories to remote sensing data for individual tree mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qian (Chayn) Sun","Tania Macleod","Alan Both","Joe Hurley","Andrew Butt","Marco Amati"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"855d03f5773ecb8e042fc35e91f76a0a","permalink":"https://alanboth.github.io/publication/2021-heat-mitigation/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-heat-mitigation/","section":"publication","summary":"Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. \n\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status.

A spatial registrar of traffic infrastructure is currently a required component of local government councils' mandatory road management plans. Recent advancements of object detection technology in machine learning have presented an automated approach for the detection and classification of street signage captured by Google's Street View (GSV) imagery. \n\nThis paper explores the possibility of using deep learning to produce an autonomous system for detecting traffic signs on GSV images to assist in traffic assets monitoring and maintenance. By leveraging Google's Street View API, this research offers an economic approach of building purposeful street sign computer vision datasets. A custom object detection model was trained to detect and classify Stop and Give Way signs from images captured at intersection approaches. Considering the output detected bounding box coordinates, photogrammetry approach was applied to calculate the approximate location of each detected sign in two-dimensional geographical space. The newly located and classified street signs can be combined with relevant spatial data for implementation into an asset management system. By combining GIS and the GSV API, the process is completely scalable to any level of street sign classification scope. \n\nThe experiments conducted on the road network of study area recorded a detection accuracy of 95.63% and classification accuracy of 97.82%. Our proposed automated approach to the detection and localisation of street sign infrastructure has displayed a promising potential for its use by local government authorities. Our workflow can be used to detect other traffic signs and applied to other road sections and other cities. Of primary importance, this approach takes an entirely free and open-source approach throughout.

It is natural to ask how to compute such a prime subnetwork, and when it is unique.

The paper shows how vehicles can be incrementally equipped with three fundamental spatial constructs: knowledge of places, of neighborhoods, and the ability to communicate with other nearby vehicles. In turn we demonstrate, using agent-based simulations, how the fundamental spatial concepts of fields, networks, objects, and reference frames can emerge from these basic constructs. Our approach contributes to ongoing efforts of identifying the core concepts of spatial information [11] and of understanding the relationships between interaction with space and spatial computation [6].","tags":null,"title":"Spatiotemporal Braitenberg vehicles","type":"publication"}]
