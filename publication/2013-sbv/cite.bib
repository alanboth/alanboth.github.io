	abstract = {How does complex spatiotemporal behavior arise from, and from which, spatiotemporal knowledge? In an attempt to answer this question, we extend Valentino Braitenberg's thought experiment [3] by describing and implementing vehicles with explicit, and increasingly sophisticated, spatiotemporal knowledge. We then observe the corresponding spatiotemporal behavior that can result. These spatiotemporal vehicles are able to move about their environment. The paper shows how vehicles can be incrementally equipped with three fundamental spatial constructs: knowledge of places, of neighborhoods, and the ability to communicate with other nearby vehicles. In turn we demonstrate, using agent-based simulations, how the fundamental spatial concepts of fields, networks, objects, and reference frames can emerge from these basic constructs. Our approach contributes to ongoing efforts of identifying the core concepts of spatial information [11] and of understanding the relationships between interaction with space and spatial computation [6].},
