<meta name="description" content="Consider the task of monitoring changes in the structure of dynamic spatial phenomena such as algal blooms or oil spills. Such phenomena consist of multiple disconnected region components, which can reconfigure over time. This work uses qualitative spatial reasoning to record only salient changes to the internal structure of these regions. 

To detect and store such qualitative spatial information, this research proposes a collection of five in-network, decentralized algorithms. Unlike previous work, these algorithms are able to operate in networks of mobile geosensor nodes with no access to coordinate information. A decentralized approach to algorithm design allows for information processing to take place within the network, with the defining feature being that no single node has access to the entirety of data in the network.
